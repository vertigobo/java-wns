## Introduction

**java-wns** is a Java client for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh913756.aspx">Windows Push Notification service (WNS)</a>.

This library will let you implement the Cloud Service of the diagram below:

## Updates
Version 1.3 released!

**1.3 Changes**
* Proxy support

**1.2 Changes** 
* Send raw notifications

**1.1 Changes** 
* Send a notification to multiple channelUris


## Steps
* <a href="#first-step---registration">First</a>, you will need to register your Windows application in the store to get a SID (Package security identifier) and Client Secret codes.

* <a href="#second-step---obtain-channel-uri">Second</a>, obtain the Channel URI of your devices.

* <a href="#third-step---send-notifications">Third</a>, use this library to authenticate with WNS and send the notifications!


### First step - Registration
Go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=234306">Windows Store app development page</a> of the Windows Dev Center and sign in with your Microsoft account.

Once you have signed in, select the Dashboard tab.

On the Dashboard, submit your Windows app and update your package.appxmanifest with the corresponding identity values.

If you want your devices to receive Toast notifications, you should also change "Toast capable" to YES in the manifest configuration.

Go to Services>Push notifications and Live Connect services info and below "If your app uses WNS for push notifications, review", select Authenticating your service.

Save the SID (Package security identifier) and Client Secret, example screenshot below:
<img src="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC582761.png"/>


### Second step - Obtain Channel URI

Add the following code to your Windows app:

Javascript
```
var channel;
var pushNotifications = Windows.Networking.PushNotifications;
var channelOperation = pushNotifications.PushNotificationChannelManager.createPushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();

return channelOperation.then(function (newChannel) {
    channel = newChannel;
    // Success. The channel URI is found in newChannel.uri.
    },
    function (error) {
        // Could not create a channel. Retrieve the error through error.number.
    }
);
```

C#
```
PushNotificationChannel channel = null;

try
{
    channel = await PushNotificationChannelManager.CreatePushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();
    // Success. The channel URI is found in channel.Uri.
}

catch (Exception ex)
{ 
    // Could not create a channel. 
}
```


### Third step - Send notifications
Now with your SID, Client Secret and Channel URI you are ready to send!

<a href="https://github.com/fernandospr/java-wns/wiki/Installation">Install this library</a> and write the following to start the service:

```
boolean logging = true;
String sid = "yourSID";
String clientSecret = "yourClientSecret";
WnsService service = new WnsService(sid, clientSecret, logging);
```

Write the following to send a Badge notification:
```
String channelUri = "yourChannelUri";
WnsBadge badge =  new WnsBadgeBuilder().value(1).build();
service.pushBadge(channelUri, badge);
```

Write the following to send a Tile notification:
```
String channelUri = "yourChannelUri";
WnsTile tile =  new WnsTileBuilder().bindingTemplateTileWideText03("Hello world").build();
service.pushTile(channelUri, tile);
```

Write the following to send a Toast notification:
```
String channelUri = "yourChannelUri";
WnsToast toast =  new WnsToastBuilder().bindingTemplateToastText01("Hello world").build();
service.pushToast(channelUri, toast);
```

Write the following to send a Raw notification:
```
String channelUri = "yourChannelUri";
WnsRaw raw =  new WnsRawBuilder().stream("Hello world".getBytes()).build();
service.pushRaw(channelUri, raw);
```


## Notification builders
To create and customize notifications, you should use the following builders:

* WnsBadgeBuilder
* WnsToastBuilder
* WnsTileBuilder
* WnsRawBuilder

WnsToastBuilder and WnsTileBuilder have methods with the following signature:
```
bindingTemplateXXX()
```
Please check the Toast and Tile templates in the <a href="#links">Links section</a> to use the one you need.


## Response headers
The pushXXX methods of WnsService return an object of the WnsNotificationResponse type. 
This object contains the values specified in the Headers (Send notification response section) in the <a href="#links">Links section</a>.


## Request optional headers
There are pushXXX methods implementations that receive an object of the WnsNotificationRequestOptional type.
You should create an object of this type and set the corresponding values, according to the Headers (Request parameters) in the <a href="#links">Links Section</a>.
